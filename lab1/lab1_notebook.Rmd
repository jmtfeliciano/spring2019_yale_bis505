## Datasets today:

Titanic roster that is saved in my GitHub account.

Let us check out the raw data via:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neonseri/spring2019_yale_bis505/master/lab1/datasets/titanic.csv



## Reading data:

Before you try `read.table()` or `read.csv()`, open the file to see raw data.  What is the structure of the dataset? Are they separated by white space or comma? Do they have a header or variable name?  

### read.csv()

```{r}
data1 <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neonseri/spring2019_yale_bis505/master/lab1/datasets/titanic.csv"))
data1
```

### read.table()

```{r}
data2 <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neonseri/spring2019_yale_bis505/master/lab1/datasets/titanic.csv"), sep = "," , header = TRUE)

data2 
```
